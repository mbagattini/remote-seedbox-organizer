List content of your seedbox organized, keep track of what you and your friends have downloaded, cleanup easily

Sharing a seedbox is great and cost-effective. However, keeping track of what's on it and what can be removed once space is getting short it's not that funny. This simple PHP/MySQL application helps you and your friend listing the content of your seedbox by connecting to it via FTP and grouping series and movies.
